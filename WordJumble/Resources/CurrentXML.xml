Test Jumble

Tips to creating a jumble:
   1) Keep answers strictly alphabetic, and less than or equal to 12 characters long
   2) Answer in the final round (round="fin") must be made up of letters found in the other answers
   3) Indicate which letter(s) from each regular answer will be used in the final answer
         (i.e. If "H" and "S" from horse would be used in the final answer, index would be 14
         because "H" was the first letter in horse and "S" was the fourth.)
   4) Do not change the round attribute
   5) Do not add or remove words. Each round will have exactly 5 regular words and 1 final word.
   6) Hint for the regular words should be brief fragments. Hint for the final should be a sentence.
   7) To change the game, save the previous game as something meaningful, and rename the file to be used "CurrentXML.xml"
